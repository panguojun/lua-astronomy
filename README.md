# Lua Astronomy
*Lua is a minimalist language. Compared with Python, its performance is very good, and it is easy to integrate with professional programming languages such as C++.*
*Astronomy is a computationally intensive science, astronomical instruments are expensive and shared, and most people work with data processing and computation.*
*Combining the two may collide with sparks*

## Dimension
Dimensions translate mathematics into science. It is easiest to calculate physical quantities in the same way as dimensional transformation.
